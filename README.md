# Unit-1-project
SE Unit 1 Project: Community Outreach and Consulting

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to:
1. Assess our mastery of the HTML and CSS foundations covered in Unit 1
2. Push us to reach for advanced HTML/CSS solutions to address new design challenges.
3. Give us the opportunity to learn and raise awareness about a social issue that is of particular importance to us. 

### Groups
This project was completed in groups of 2-3. Groups will add an additional set of complexities to this task, as developing software collaboratively requires coordinating schedules for meetings, negotiating product vision, developing and being disciplined about your Git workflow, among many other things.

### Process
1. Identify a cause or social issue in your communities that you want to support, learn more about, or raise awareness for. This could be national issue such as voter suppression, racial injustice, or education inequality. You could choose to highlight a local issue or one impacting your family's home country. What is important to note is that you do _not_ have to be an expert on this issue nor does every single member of the group have to have expertise on an issue. You should think of this project as a learning experience that will start this week but will carry on throughout the year in L&D as we explore different social issue.
2. Perform initial research on this social issue. Each person in your group will find relevant information on the issue and bring it back to the group for review. Together, you will decide what information should be highlighted in your website.
3. Your website will consist of **multiple webpages linked together**. After you have performed your initial research, you will create a wireframe or mockup for website. This will serve as the creative guide or outline for what you will build using HTML and CSS. 
4. You will implement the website collaboratively using industry best practices: Paired Programming, branching, merging, etc.  
5. Once your team completes the website, you will publish it using [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site).
6. Your group will prepare a brief presentation in Google Slides in order to tell the story of the creation of your website. You will discuss the challenges and solutions that each member of the team had to overcome in order to ship the final version of your website.
